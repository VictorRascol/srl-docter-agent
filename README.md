# srl-docter-agent: Tailored telemetry for every network node

Networks form complex, distributed systems whose primary function of providing connectivity and data transport services is constantly challenged by real-world events that disrupt the normal flow of operations. As engineers who are assigned to monitor and troubleshoot networks know well, figuring out what the hell happened, or what causes packet drops every so often, can be a daunting task. 

With the SRL Docter agent, engineers can put specific nodes under intensive care, monitoring for specific correlated events that expose patterns of causality not seen through ordinary approaches.

# Example: BGP flaps due to MAC table exhaustion
